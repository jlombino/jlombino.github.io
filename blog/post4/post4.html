										<h3>Tensorflow on Radeon GPUs with Docker</h3>

										<p>
											I expect this to be an extremely niche blog post, but today I will explain how I
											got tensorflow to utilize my RX 6000 series GPU. While it is great for gaming, the
											RX 6000 series does not support CUDA which tensorflow and most other machine learning
											libraries rely on for GPU acceleration. Fortunately, I found a 
											<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/tensorflow/">docker image</a> that had the solution
											to this, pre-configured and ready for use. If you aren't familiar with docker, it allows you
											to run applications in containers similar to virtual machines. It is commonly used to deploy
											applications because it is secure, efficient, and easy to configure and maintain.
										</p>

										<p>
											I am performing these steps on Ubuntu 22.04 with an RX 6000 series GPU, but this method
											may also work with other operating systems and older GPUs.
										</p>

										<h3>
											If you decide to follow these steps, do so at your own risk. Back up your data before modifying 
											your system.
										</h3><br>
										
										<p>
											Before I get to the details, please enjoy this picture of my dog Bentley.

										<hr>
										<h3>1. Install Docker</h3>

										<p>
											I followed the steps outlined in the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">
											documentation</a> to install docker on my system. I then added my user account
											to the relevant group so that I could run docker commands without using sudo in the future.
										</p>
										<p>I created a docker group using:</p>
										<pre>sudo groupadd docker</pre>

										<p>Then I added my user to the docker group with:</p>
										<pre>sudo gpasswd -a my_username docker</pre>

										<p>Finally, I rebooted my computer so the changes would take effect.</p>
										
										<hr>

										<h3>2. Download the Relevant Docker Image</h3>

										<p>I made a folder in my home directory to share with the docker container using:</p>
										<pre>mkdir ~/DockerShare</pre>

										<p>I then downloaded the relevant docker image (22GB) from dockerhub using:</p>
										<pre>docker pull rocm/tensorflow</pre>

										<p>I could now run the downloaded docker container using the following command:</p>
										<pre>docker run -it --network=host --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --ipc=host
											--shm-size 16G --group-add video --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined
											-v $HOME/DockerShare:/DockerShare -w="/DockerShare" rocm/tensorflow:latest</pre>
											
										<p>After running this command I was presented with a shell running inside the container.</p>

										<hr>

										<h3>3. Verify the GPU is Working</h3>

										<p>Once I had the container shell, I started python using:</p>
										<pre>python3</pre>

										<p>I then verified my GPU was working by running the following code in python:</p>
										<pre>import tensorflow as tf<br>
										tf.config.list_physical_devices()</pre>

										<p>I knew it was working because the list of physical devices contained:</p>
										<pre>PhysicalDevice(name='/physical_device:GPU:0', device_type='GPU')</pre>

										<p>Having verified that my GPU was recognized, I quit out of python.</p>
									
										<hr>

										<h3>4. Modifying the Image for Data Science</h3>

										<p>
											Now that I knew tensorflow recognized my GPU, it was time to modify the docker image to better
											suit my needs. Out of the box, it only comes with the few python modules required to run
											tensorflow. This does not include key data science modules such as Pandas, Matplotlib, or
											JupyterLab/Notebook. The container also does not have persistence outside the DockerShare folder. 
											This means that any system changes I make while the container is running, including installing
											modules, will be reset the next time I launch the container. Only changes made in the DockerShare
											folder would remain. I solved these issues by installing all of the necessary modules, and committing
											the changes to a new docker image.
										</p>

										<p>
											While the container was running, I used pip to install all of the extra modules I wanted:
										</p>
										<pre>pip install pandas matplotlib notebook</pre>

										<p>I then opened a new terminal on the host OS and ran the command to bring up a list of docker processes:</p>
										<pre>docker ps</pre>

										<p>From this list, I copied the name of the running container (this changes each time the container
											is run). I then ran the following command to commit the changes to a new docker container with
											the jupyter tag:
										</p>

										<pre>docker commit name_I_copied rocm/tensorflow:jupyter</pre>

										<p>I then stopped the running container.</p>

										<hr>

										<h3>5. Create a Shortcut</h3>

										<p>I could now use the following command to run the image I just made:</p>
										<pre>docker run -it --network=host --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --ipc=host
											--shm-size 16G --group-add video --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined
											-v $HOME/DockerShare:/DockerShare -w="/DockerShare" rocm/tensorflow:jupyter</pre>
										
										<p>
											Because I would be using this command often in the future, I added an alias for it in my 
											.bashrc file. I opened the file using vim, but any text editor will work. I then added the following
											line at the bottom of the file:
										</p>
										<pre>alias datasci='docker run -it --network=host --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --ipc=host
											--shm-size 16G --group-add video --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined
											-v $HOME/DockerShare:/DockerShare -w="/DockerShare" rocm/tensorflow:jupyter'</pre>

										<p>After restarting my terminal, I could now use the command datasci to launch the new docker image.</p>

										<hr>

										<h3>6. Run Jupyter Notebook</h3>

										<p>That's it. Whenever I want to utilize my GPU for tensorflow, I run the following commands to
											launch the container and start a jupyter server within the docker container:
										</p>
										<pre>datasci</pre>
										<pre>jupyter notebook --allow-root</pre>
										<p>Finally, I paste one of the links jupyter provides into my web browser. The notebook runs
											as normal, but with GPU acceleration.
										</p>

										<p>Becuase I am using the same GPU for tensorflow and my display output, I use a method outlined
											in the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/config/set_logical_device_configuration">
												tensorflow documentation</a> to limit the amount of VRAM tensorflow can use. This is necessary
												because allowing tensorflow to use all available VRAM can result in a laggy desktop environment.
