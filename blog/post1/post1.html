										<h3>Howdy,</h3>
					
										<p>
											I stressed way too much about writing this. It took me over four days to write this 
											and you probably aren't even going to have to scroll down to read the whole thing. This has always been me though. 
											For the past 25.7205 years of my life I have always worried more about the things other people find easy 
											and enjoyed the things other people find hard. In fact, I am at my best when the problem seems impossible 
											because I live for the feeling of outperforming my best expectations. Here is a picture of my dog Bentley, 
											before I forget.
										</p>

										<h3>Here's some basic stuff about me:</h3>
										
										<ul>
											<li>I am from NYC.</li>
											<li>I have no idea how CSS works.</li>
											<li>I enjoy playing handball, chess, and videogames such as Minecraft.</li>
											<li>I trade stocks, options, and futures for fun!</li>
											<li>I have a B.S. degree in chemical engineering from the University of Delaware.</li>
											<li>I have 10 fingers and 10 toes.</li>
											<li>I enjoy optimization problems a bit too much.</li>
											<li>I most recently worked as an estimator in the HVAC industry.</li>
										</ul>
										
										<h3>Data Science?</h3>
										
										<p>
											Chemical engineering involves way less chemistry than you would think. Statistics, linear algebra, and 
											differential equations are truly the name of the game. While I did spend my fair share of time in a 
											laboratory, it doesn't compare to all of the time I spent trying to understand and remember all of the 
											variations of the Navier-Stokes equations. Little did I know how useful some of this would be in preparing 
											me for my future career in data science.
										</p>
										
										<p>
											Following school, I had a great opportunity to get hands-on experience with some substantial HVAC systems. 
											Before the pandemic brought the construction industry to a halt, my primary role involved traveling 
											throughout NYC to price and plan-out water treatment services for cooling towers. Following the lead of 
											more experienced technicians, I learned all about how to operate HVAC systems safely and reliably. 
										</p>

										<h3>The Future?</h3>
										
										<p>
											I am fortunate enough to say that many aspects of the data science curriculum at Flatiron School will not 
											be new to me. A substantial portion of chemical engineering involves modeling empirical data from chemical 
											processes. In addition, I have been using (rudimentary) python to automate my estimating work and analyze my 
											trades for years. While I am beyond excited to explore machine learning and the like, I am equally happy 
											just to be a participant in the Flatiron professional community. I am most interested in working on projects 
											that aim to understand and remedy mental health issues in the future.
										</p>
										
										<p>
											If you've made it this far, don't forget to tune in next time where I'll be discussing the reasons every 
											chart should be a pie chart.
