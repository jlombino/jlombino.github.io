											Welcome back! Today, I will be introducing you to SQL.
											SQL is the most popular language used for interacting with databases - a common
											activity in the life of a data scientist. While SQL is not too difficult to learn, it
											is extremely powerful. The syntax resembles plain english with keywords CAPITALIZED
											(although this is technically not necessary).<br><br>

											There are many flavors of SQL such as MySQL, SQLite, and PostgreSQL. 
											I will be working with SQLite today, using Python with the Pandas
											and SQLite3 modules to run my queries. You should be able to follow along with your 
											preferred implementation. Before I get to the tutorial though, here is today's Bentley picture.
										</p>

										<center><img src="img_bentley.jpg" alt="Good Boy!" width="80%"></center>

										<br>
										<p>
											I will be using <a href="https://github.com/jlombino/dsc-phase-1-project/blob/main/zippedData/im.db.zip">data</a> 
											from my movie analysis project for this tutorial. This dataset has not been cleaned, so you may occasionally see NaN values. This
											is just indicative of missing data. There is no problem with the query being run, and I am not checking for
											null values in each query to keep them short and readable.<br><br>

											If you downloaded the data to follow along, please note that it is compressed. You will need to unzip it to access
											the data inside. If you are using Python, the following code can be used to establish a connection to the database and execute a query.
											Just enter the path to your database file and the query you want to execute.
										
										</p>

										<pre>import pandas as pd<br>
										import sqlite3<br>
										connection = sqlite3.connect(*path to database*)<br>
										df = pd.read_sql(*query*,connection)</pre>

										<hr>
										<h2>Database Structure</h2>
										<br>

										<p>
											Databases group data into tables. Each table can contain various keys which can be thought of as
											columns on a spreadsheet. Entries in the table can be thought of as spreadsheet rows and will have a value assigned to each key. Keys
											can be primary or foreign. The main difference is that primary keys need to be unique such that two entries in a table 
											can not have the same value for the primary key. The tables are often visualized in entity relationship diagrams.
											Here is the diagram for the data I will be using today.
										</p>

										<center><img src="img_tables.jpeg" width="80%"></center>
										
										<p>
											Each box in the diagram represents a table, and the rows in each box represent keys. Lines connecting two tables indicate
											that the tables are related and have keys in common. I will be focusing on the <b>movie_basics</b> and <b>movie_ratings</b> tables for 
											this tutorial. The movie_basics table has the following keys:
											<ul>
												<li><b> movie_id - Primary Key</b></li>
												<li>primary_title</li>
												<li>primary_title</li>
												<li>start_year</li>
												<li>runtime_minutes</li>
												<li>genres</li>
											</ul>
										</p>

										<hr>
										<h2>The SELECT Keyword</h2>
										<br>

										<p>
											Now that we know how our data is organized, we can start working with it. I will exclusively focus on SELECT queries 
											today because they are used to retrieve data from a database without modifying it. I believe this is the most important query to be
											comfortable writing as a beginner. It is also possible to modify databases with queries by using INSERT INTO, DROP, 
											DELETE, and other keywords but I will save those for another time.
										</p>

										<hr>
										<h2>Basic Queries</h2>
										<br>

										<p>
											Let's start with a basic query. Here, we will extract the title, release year, and runtime for every movie
											in the database. This information is all located in the movie_basics table so this is a simple task. We can run a query
											with the following structure:<br>
											<pre>SELECT [keys we want or * for all keys] FROM [table we want]</pre>
											Or, in this case:<br>
											<pre>SELECT primary_title, start_year, runtime_minutes FROM movie_basics</pre>
											Here are the first five entries from the results of that query. There are about 146,000 other entries not shown here that
											we just extracted from the database as well.
										</p>	

										<table>
											<thead>
											<tr style="text-align: left;">
												<th>primary_title</th>
												<th>start_year</th>
												<th>runtime_minutes</th>
											</tr>
											</thead>
											<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td>Sunghursh</td>
												<td>2013</td>
												<td>175.0</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>One Day Before the Rainy Season</td>
												<td>2019</td>
												<td>114.0</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>The Other Side of the Wind</td>
												<td>2018</td>
												<td>122.0</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Sabse Bada Sukh</td>
												<td>2018</td>
												<td>NaN</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>The Wandering Soap Opera</td>
												<td>2017</td>
												<td>80.0</td>
											</tr>
											</tbody>
										</table>

										<h2>Ordering</h2>
										<br>

										<p>
											It is easy to order the data using a SQL query with the ORDER BY keyword. We can simply add the keyword
											to the end of our last query followed by the key we wish to use for ordering. The default order is ascending,
											but we can specify DESC to change this to descending. The following query returns the same results as the 
											previous query, but with the results ordered by start year. Once again, here are the first five entries.<br>

											<pre>SELECT primary_title, start_year, runtime_minutes<br>
												FROM movie_basics<br>
												ORDER BY start_year</pre>
										</p>
										<table>
											<thead>
											<tr style="text-align: left;">
												<th>primary_title</th>
												<th>start_year</th>
												<th>runtime_minutes</th>
											</tr>
											</thead>
											<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td>PÃ¡l Adrienn</td>
												<td>2010</td>
												<td>136.0</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>So Much for Justice!</td>
												<td>2010</td>
												<td>100.0</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Children of the Green Dragon</td>
												<td>2010</td>
												<td>89.0</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>The Final Journey</td>
												<td>2010</td>
												<td>120.0</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Quantum Quest: A Cassini Space Odyssey</td>
												<td>2010</td>
												<td>45.0</td>
											</tr>
											</tbody>
										</table>

										<hr>
										<h2>Limiting Results</h2>
										<br>

										<p>
											So far, I have been using the Pandas head method to show only the first five results from our query. We can
											actually limit the number of results directly in the query by adding LIMIT followed by the number of results we want.
											For example, the following query will return the first five entries in our results ordered by year.<br>

											<pre>SELECT primary_title, start_year, runtime_minutes<br>
												FROM movie_basics<br>
												ORDER BY start_year<br>
												LIMIT 5</pre>

											The result of this query should be the exact same as the above table.
										</p>

										<hr><h2>Selecting Specific Data</h2><br>

										<p>
											It is also easy to limit which entries a query returns using the WHERE keyword. This checks whether each entry meets a specified
											condition. For example, the following query will check whether each entry has a year less 
											than 2015 and only return those that do. This brings us down to about 60,000 results.<br>
											<pre>SELECT primary_title, start_year, runtime_minutes<br>
												FROM movie_basics<br>
												WHERE start_year < 2015</pre>
										</p>

										<table>
											<thead>
											<tr style="text-align: left;">
												<th>primary_title</th>
												<th>start_year</th>
												<th>runtime_minutes</th>
											</tr>
											</thead>
											<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td>Sunghursh</td>
												<td>2013</td>
												<td>175.0</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>O SilÃªncio</td>
												<td>2012</td>
												<td>NaN</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Nema aviona za Zagreb</td>
												<td>2012</td>
												<td>82.0</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>PÃ¡l Adrienn</td>
												<td>2010</td>
												<td>136.0</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>So Much for Justice!</td>
												<td>2010</td>
												<td>100.0</td>
											</tr>
											</tbody>
										</table>
										
										<hr> <p>
											It is possible to have multiple conditions after the WHERE keyword by using AND or OR. 
											The following query returns movies made before 2015 that are also longer than 120 minutes.<br>
											<pre>SELECT primary_title, start_year, runtime_minutes<br>
												FROM movie_basics<br>
												WHERE start_year < 2015<br>
												AND runtime_minutes > 120</pre>
										</p>

										<table>
											<thead>
											<tr style="text-align: left;">
												<th>primary_title</th>
												<th>start_year</th>
												<th>runtime_minutes</th>
											</tr>
											</thead>
											<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td>Sunghursh</td>
												<td>2013</td>
												<td>175.0</td>

												<td>PÃ¡l Adrienn</td>
												<td>2010</td>
												<td>136.0</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Cooper and Hemingway: The True Gen</td>
												<td>2013</td>
												<td>180.0</td>

										<h2>A Quick Pause</h2>
										<br>
										<p>
											This blog is packed with information, and learning a new language is always difficult. Take a minute to grab some coffee or tea,
											or just let your brain digest everything we have gone over so far. I will still be here when you're ready to continue.
										</p>

										<center><img src="img_stop.jpg" width="80%"></center><br>
										
										<hr><h2>Grouping and Aggregate Functions</h2><br>

										<p>
											SQL makes it easy to gain insight into our data using aggregate functions. Some examples are COUNT, SUM, AVG,
											MIN, and MAX. When using these functions, we typically also use GROUP BY to split the data into groups. 
											For example, we can calculate the number of movies in each year with the following query.<br>

											<pre>SELECT start_year, COUNT()<br>
												FROM movie_basics<br>
												GROUP BY start_year</pre>

											COUNT( ) goes after the SELECT keyword and will count the number of movies in each of the start_year groups 
											we made using GROUP BY. Here are the first five results.
										</p>

										<table>
											<thead>
											<tr style="text-align: left;">
												<th>start_year</th>
												<th>COUNT()</th>
											</tr>
											</thead>
											<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td>2010</td>
												<td>11849</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>2011</td>
												<td>12900</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>2012</td>
												<td>13787</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>2013</td>
												<td>14709</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>2014</td>
												<td>15589</td>
											</tr>
											</tbody>
										</table>
										
										<p>
											It is even possible to combine the WHERE keyword with GROUP BY and aggregate functions.
											For example, we can limit the previous query to only include movies longer than 120 minutes.
											We can use the WHERE keyword before GROUP BY to include only the relevant movies.<br>

											<pre>SELECT start_year, COUNT()<br>
												FROM movie_basics<br>
												WHERE runtime_minutes > 120<br>
												GROUP BY start_year</pre>
										</p>

										<table>
											<thead>
											<tr style="text-align: left;">
												<th>start_year</th>
												<th>COUNT()</th>
											</tr>
											</thead>
											<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td>2010</td>
												<td>682</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>2011</td>
												<td>718</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>2012</td>
												<td>773</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>2013</td>
												<td>882</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>2014</td>
												<td>984</td>
											</tr>
											</tbody>
										</table>
										
										<hr><h2>Joining Tables</h2><br>

										<p>
											So far, we have only used data from the movie_basics table. This does not need to be the case though.
											SQL makes it easy to join tables together allowing you to use information from any or all of them. Tables
											can be joined on shared keys using the JOIN and ON keywords. There are four important types of joins.
											<ul>
												<li>Inner join keeps data with values present in <b>both</b> tables.</li>
												<li>Outer join keeps data with values present in <b>either</b> table.</li>
												<li>Left join keeps data with values present in the <b>first</b> table.</li>
												<li>Right join keeps data with values present in the <b>second</b> table.</li>
											</ul>
											The following example will utilize an inner join which only keeps entries that have values in both tables.
											Using a different type of join can result in many null values in your results. The correct join to use
											depends mostly on your data and what you are trying to accomplish; there is no universally best join.<br><br>

											Now we would like our results to include the averate rating for each movie. This data is located on the movie_ratings 
											table, so we will need to join that with the movie_basics table where the rest of our data is located. This complicates
											things because we need to precede our key names with table names to avoid ambiguity. We also need a shared key between the tables
											(in this case movie_id) to join them on. The following query joins the two relevant tables and extracts the information
											from the relevant keys of each table.<br>

											<pre>SELECT movie_basics.primary_title,<br>
											movie_basics.start_year,<br>
											movie_ratings.averagerating<br>
											FROM movie_basics<br>
											INNER JOIN movie_ratings<br>
											ON movie_basics.movie_id = movie_ratings.movie_id</pre>
										</p>

										<table>
											<thead>
											<tr style="text-align: left;">
												<th>primary_title</th>
												<th>start_year</th>
												<th>averagerating</th>
											</tr>
											</thead>
											<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td>Sunghursh</td>
												<td>2013</td>
												<td>7.0</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>One Day Before the Rainy Season</td>
												<td>2019</td>
												<td>7.2</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>The Other Side of the Wind</td>
												<td>2018</td>
												<td>6.9</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Sabse Bada Sukh</td>
												<td>2018</td>
												<td>6.1</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>The Wandering Soap Opera</td>
												<td>2017</td>
												<td>6.5</td>
											</tr>
											</tbody>
										</table>

										<hr>
										<h2>Putting it All Together</h2
											><br>

										<p>
											Unsurprisingly, you can use GROUP BY and aggregate functions even when joining several tables.
											We can now find the average rating of movies released each year similarly to how we found the number 
											of movies released each year above. We just use the AVG function instead of COUNT, and precede 
											each of our keys with the table they are from to avoid ambiguity. The following query accomplishes
											this task.<br>
											<pre>
												SELECT movie_basics.start_year,<br>
												AVG(movie_ratings.averagerating)<br>
												FROM movie_basics<br>
												INNER JOIN movie_ratings<br>
												ON movie_basics.movie_id = movie_ratings.movie_id<br>
												GROUP BY movie_basics.start_year
											</pre>
										</p>

										<table>
											<thead>
											<tr>
												<th>start_year</th>
												<th>AVG(movie_ratings.averagerating)</th>
											</tr>
											</thead>
											<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td>2010</td>
												<td>6.259585</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>2011</td>
												<td>6.290134</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>2012</td>
												<td>6.297057</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>2013</td>
												<td>6.287259</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>2014</td>
												<td>6.319806</td>
											</tr>
											</tbody>
										</table>

										<h2>The End!</h2>
										<br>
										
										<p>
											I hope this tutorial has proved helpful to you. SQL will be very useful to you
											if you are interested in a career in data science or data analytics. As I mentioned before, this tutorial is
											by no means comprehensive; it only covers very simple SELECT queries. There are many more things you can do with
											SQL including but not limited to:
											<ul>
												<li>Drop or impute missing data</li>
												<li>Create and update database records and tables</li>
												<li>Further filter results using nested queries</li>

											</ul>
